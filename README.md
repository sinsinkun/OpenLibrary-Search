# Open Library Search Tool

This is a basic app built to allow a quick search through the open library database, which contains a vast array of books written in all languages.

The app can be viewed through the link below. If you would like to run this app locally, please clone the repo and run "npm install" to install all related packages. Then run "npm start", and the app will automatically launch in your browser.

Notes:
- The app uses a hashrouter because github pages does not support regular routing for react applications
- The open library API only produces 100 results per search, and therefore cannot be properly sorted through queries that produce a large number of results.

This app is deployed at: https://sinsinkun.github.io/OpenLibrary-Search
